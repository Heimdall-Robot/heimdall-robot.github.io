# Welcome

Heimdallr (pronounced _High-m-dollar_) Systems is a group of four Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University students
developing an autonomous patrol robot for our robotics capstone. Our robot will be capable of patrolling a building
and identifying possible dangers to security automatically, reducing human workload.
