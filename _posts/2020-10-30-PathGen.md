title: Completion of the Kinematic Model and Start of Joint Space Trajectory Calculation
---
As of 10/26/20, the full forward and inverse kinematic model of the robot was completed with
respect to both the body and inertial frames. For the forward and inverse kinematic models with
respect to the body frame, only the joint angles need to be known. When working with respect
to the inertial frame, some assumptions about the position of the contact points of the legs
are assumed to be known. This means that these positions must be kept track of through any
amount of steps that the robot takes. After making these assumptions, the complete position
and orientation of the robot's body and links are able to be solved for.

Now with a full kinematic model completed, we are moving on to joint space trajectory 
generation. This means that if a trajectory, or set of desired positions, of the body is given,
then through numerical solving methods we can generate another trajectory of joint space values, or
a set of joint angles, that achieve the desired body positions. This will allow our robot to 
move in a smooth path in any direction.
