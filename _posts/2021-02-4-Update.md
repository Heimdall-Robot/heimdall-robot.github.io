title: Controlling, Redesigning, and Testing Legs
---

This week, a method for individually controlling legs independent of the main
body controller has been created. The robot is now able to lift one leg in order
to step while using the other three legs to move and tilt its body as desired.
A logical controller for determining when and how to step has already been made.
Now the logical controller and the singular leg controller will be combined
to allow for full walking functionality.

Aside from the controls, the robots proportions including body size and leg
length are being redesign in order to allow for balance to be maintained easier.
