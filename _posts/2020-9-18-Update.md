title: The beginning of conceptual design.
---

This past week all of the team members developed their own independent proposals for how the robot will accomplish the
requirements that we had previously decided on. We began presenting on these concepts today, with Trevor and Alex
presenting their concepts to the class. On Monday, Nick and I will be presenting our concepts. Once those presentations
have been finished, they will be uploaded to the site.
