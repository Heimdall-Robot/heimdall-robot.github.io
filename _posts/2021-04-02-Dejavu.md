title: Dejavu, or the tale of the PCB
---

This past week the PCB went through another redesign. It turned out tha the power regulator IC that the team had
selected had a very odd limitation: It required an I2C command to begin supplying power. Unfortunately, the device that
would supply the I2C command requires power from the regulator to be able to send it, creating a catch-22. Due to this,
a new regulator was source from Pololu on Amazon. This arrived this friday, and has been confirmed to work.

Other news: Gabe is working on code to read the servo positions with the ADC. Trevor is integrating the IMU into
RTABMap, Nick is continuing on working on the test document, and Alex is building the robot (The legs have been
assembled and feet have been printed. We are nearing final assembly!)
