title: Turning, Converting to C, and Building
---

A turning algorithm has successfully been developed, allowing the robot to
face any direction. Now the focus of software development has been placed on
converting these algorithms to C. For ease of use, the entire walking/turning
algorithm has been placed into one function.

Now that all of our parts have arrived, the parts of the robot are starting to
machined. Both the software and hardware sides of this project are coming closer
to being able to be used for a physical robot.
