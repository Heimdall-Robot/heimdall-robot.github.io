title: Confirming Walking Algorithm through Kinematic Simulation
---

After observing multiple flaws related to stability with the previous walking
algorithm, we decided to completely remake it. Instead of moving the body
and then deciding when and how to step, the robot now instead always steps
if the desired body goal is outside of a certain boundary. The body pose controller
is used to maintain stability or reach goals that are close to the robot.

Here is a video that shows proof of concept.

Now some slight issues with this algorithm will be ironed out. Next, an algorithm
for stepping to turn will be designed.
