title: Building, Fixing, and Rebuilding
---

This past week has been full of work. The physical construction of the robot is moving already at a brisk pace.
Virtually all of the structure has been fabricated, the body has been assembled, with Alex working on building the legs.

Things have not been running as well on the electronics side. A PCB design was milled and the power regulation circuitry
was soldered to it. However, the regulator did not appear to be working. After testing, it was determined that the
voltage input was not routed correctly. Some SMD rework was performed to patch the design. After this fix, the regulator
was able to output a 3.2V signal. However, the I2C Communication with the regulator could not be obtained. Because of
this, an additional review of the PCB will be performed to verify all of components are wired up correctly.

Due to this, software development has been on hold this past week as the PCB assembly and testing has taken up most of
the time. However, Trevor plans to get back to work on the software starting on Monday.

Finally, Nick has begun work on the test document, which will detail all of the test and development processes that the
team has followed.
