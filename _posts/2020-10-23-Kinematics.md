title: Kinematic Progress
---

As before, we have been chugging along with our work. This past week, made a decent bit of headway on the kinematics
of the robot. Nick has been leading the charge on this, and has completed the forward kinematic calculations, and the
inverse kinematics for the legs. Additionally, he is almost done developing the inverse kinematic equations for
how the robot will control the tilt of its body. Once complete, he intends to develop some basic kinematic equations
to help the robot maintain static stability.

Alex has been moving ahead with a much more detailed 3D model, that takes into account the strength of the material.
There has also been some discussion about discussing with the AXFAB about the possibilities of use composites on the
robot.

Gabe and trevor have developed a block diagram that details the software components of the robot, and how they
interact with sensors and actuators. Trevor is now using this to refine the pricing and power consumption data that we
have, and Gabe is using that to help design the ROS framework.

Finally, Gabe is looking into using the Quanser Qbots that are in the robotics lab in order to test some of the software
components.
