title: Beginning of the Prelim Work
---

As of Monday the team has finished up the the near continuous presentations on our concept, and begun actual work on the
project. We have created a preliminary schedule for the work that we will be doing for the rest of the semester, and
split the tasks up amongst ourselves based on what skills we each have. Currently, work is being done on a preliminary
CAD model, developing kinematic equations for the robot, and selecting the main computer and sensors that the robot will
use.
