title: Learning How to Walk
---

We determined that the motors for the robot are indeed strong enough to
allow for the robot to maintain balance when completing simple movements.
We confirmed this by conducting a dynamical simulation where the joint
torques controlling the robot in the simulation are saturated at the 
motors' stall torques. 

Now we are developing the algorithm that allows for the robot to walk.
Currently, we have the logical condition to execute a step movement developed.
Now we are working on the controls portion of moving the leg, and planning
where to step.
