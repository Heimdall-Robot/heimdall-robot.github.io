Work on the preliminary design has continued at a steady pace. The basic forward kinematics have been worked out, and
Nick has begun developing the inverse kinematic equations. Trevor has been working on implementing basic walking
simulations in MATLAB. Alex is handling CAD work for both of these projects, while Gabe is learning how ROS works,
to hopefully use it to implement a simulation by the end of the semester.
