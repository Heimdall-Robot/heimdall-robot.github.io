title: Start of Detail Semester
---

To start off this semester, we needed to confirm that the motors still allow for sufficient
movement of the robot given voltage saturation conditions. We implemented a 7.2V saturation
to help model the motors in simulation more realistically and discovered that the motor
models are either innacurrate or not strong enough. We instead tested the simulation model
that did not include motors, only the joint forces. We saturated the forces at 1.47Nm, the
estimated stall torque of the motors, and discovered that the robot fails to maintain balance
when it twists, or turns without moving its legs. 

We are currently discussing this problem.
