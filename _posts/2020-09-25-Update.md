title: Continued Conceptual Design
---

This past week we finished up the individual conceptual design presentations, and we began work on our group conceptual
design that we will be presenting on Monday. One big change that was made was a decision to move towards a four leg
design, as it will give the robot more multi-terrain capabilities. However, the robot will still have a way to have
motorized wheels attached to it to it, so that it can travel at higher speeds on prepared surfaces.

On Monday after our presentations, we are going to take photographs, so hopefully by this time next week the team bio
pages will actually have information on them.
