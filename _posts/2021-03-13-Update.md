Many big things have happened this past week. Continued issues with RTABMap led to the team deciding to downgrade to
using ROS1 instead of ROS2, allowing for us to use pre-built binaries.

At the same time, Alex has begun building the robot, as he has finished the 3D printing of all of the parts. 

The last big news is that the first pass on coverting MATLAB Code to C++ has been completed, allowing trevor to begin 
work on integrating the kinematics code into the main ROS program.
