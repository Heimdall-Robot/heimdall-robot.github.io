title: Nearing the end of the planning sprint
---

This past week we presented on our team conceptual design to the class, and unveiled our new legged concept. There
was some questions regarding our decision of 4 legs, as it did not entirely line up with our decision matrix, but we
managed to clear most of them up. We have starting working on writing preliminary testing criteria, and will be
presenting them on Monday. Once that is complete, we will have finished up our core planning work, and can get started
on a actually working on the design of the robot, and simulating it in high-fidelity.
