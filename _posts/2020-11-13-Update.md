title: Trajectory Generation and Dynamics Start
---

This week, the trajectory generator was completed. The trajectory generator solves for leg joint angles
that give a desired body position and orientation. In order to accomplish this, the existing inverse
kinematics model was used to provide an analytical solution in terms of joint angles. With a Newton-
Raphson numerical solving method, the joint angles can be solved for that satisfy the desired body pose.
Each leg's contact point and the body's position and orientation are used as constraints, which allow
for the joint angles to be solved for.

Currently the system dynamics are being solved for. Ideally, an open loop simulation with gravity effects
should be completed soon.
