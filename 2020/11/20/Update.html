<p>The dynamical model for the robot has been completed, allowing for physical motion
of the robot to be simulated. Using the joint space trajectory generator, along with
and estimated model of the servo motors being used, a control system was integrated
into the model, allowing for the robot to achieve desired poses within its workspace.
Currently, the walking gait of the robot has not been constructed so the control
system only applies to desired poses within a workspace defined by given leg contact
point positions.</p>

<p>Heimdallr systems will now focus on writing a preliminary design document. The next
goal related to control systems is to figure how the robot will take steps.</p>
