<p>We determined that the motors for the robot are indeed strong enough to
allow for the robot to maintain balance when completing simple movements.
We confirmed this by conducting a dynamical simulation where the joint
torques controlling the robot in the simulation are saturated at the
motors’ stall torques.</p>

<p>Now we are developing the algorithm that allows for the robot to walk.
Currently, we have the logical condition to execute a step movement developed.
Now we are working on the controls portion of moving the leg, and planning
where to step.</p>
