Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It allows you to define a rich txt page in
plain text, using simple commands, some of which are:

```markdown
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

* Also A
* Bulleted List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link text](Link URL) and ![Image](src)
```
